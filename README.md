# 2048 Game

This is a clone of the popular game 2048, created using WinForm C# .Net. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. In the context of the 2048 game, arrays are used to represent the game board and the tiles on the board. The game logic involves sliding tiles in arrays and merging them together based on their values. Understanding how arrays work and how to interact with them is essential for developing games and other applications.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the tiles in the desired direction.
- Tiles with the same number will merge into one when they touch.
- The game ends when there are no more moves available or when you reach the 2048 tile.
